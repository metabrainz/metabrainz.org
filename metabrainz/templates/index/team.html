        <p>
          A bitmap is a type of memory organization or image file format used to store digital images. The term bitmap comes
          from the computer programming terminology, meaning just a map of bits, a spatially mapped array of bits. Now, along
          with pixmap, it commonly refers to the similar concept of a spatially mapped array of pixels. Raster images in general
          may be referred to as bitmaps or pixmaps, whether synthetic or photographic, in files or memory.
