  <p>
    The MetaBrainz Foundation wishes to offer a huge thank you to all of our
    sponsors and partners for their support in helping MusicBrainz operate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the following organizations and individuals have provided funding,
    others have supported us by providing access to tools and technologies that
    have helped us grow. In either case they played a significant role in the
    success and growth of MusicBrainz.
  </p>
  <p>We would not exist without you — <b>Thank You!</b></p>

  <h2>Special thanks</h2>
  <p>
    In our past, we've had a lot of people support us with many different levels of support:
    Access to conferences, covering travel expenses, large personal donations and countless
    meals. These have become too numerous to list, but we wanted to note a few individuals
    who have made a big difference for us.
  </p>

    Richard Jones of <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm fame</a> donated <b>$50,000</b> in 2010,
    <a href="https://www.oracle.com/sun">Sun Microsystems</a> & Paul Lamere donated a database
    server and <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a> gave MusicBrainz $500 to
    start off a bank account for the project before the MetaBrainz Foundation existed.
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edcavazos">Ed Cavazos</a> periodically provides pro-bono
