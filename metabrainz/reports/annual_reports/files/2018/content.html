<h2>Archive notice</h2>

<p>
Annual reports from 2006 to 2017 are still available for the record.
There was no annual report in this form before 2006.
Since 2018, no annual report has been produced as there wasnâ€™t enough interest into it.
Most of the information it was gathering is nowadays available as follows:
