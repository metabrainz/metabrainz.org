Hello!

Our records show that the attached invoices remains outstanding or not marked as paid. We frequently
do not get invoice numbers attached to the payments we receive, which makes reconciling invoices
difficult, so please bear with us if you've made payment already. If you think we've sent you this
reminder in error, we apologize -- please send us a note on which date you made payment on this invoice and
which service you used to pay the invoice and we will get it credited.
